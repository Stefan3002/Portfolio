            <p>Since I was a kid, I found teaching a computer what to do, to be extraordinary. Just by writing lines of code you can create such amazing things. Your imagination is the only limit.
                I am very passioned about anything related to programming and computers.
                Right now I am a student at the West University of Timi»ôoara and I intend to master WEB Technologies and become a full-stack WEB Developer.</p>
